## What is Appium?
* <b>Appium</b> is an <b>open-source</b> tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms.
* <b>Appium</b> is <b>cross-platform</b>: it allows you to write tests against multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows), using the same API.
* You can write <b>Appium</b> tests with different programming languages such as (Java, Python, Javascript, C#, and Ruby).

# 1- Introduction to Mobile Testing
* Testing your mobile app is a vital part of the app development process.
* By running tests against your mobile app, you can verify your app's correctness, functional behaviour, and usability before you release it public.
<br><br>
<b> Native Vs. Cross-Platform Mobile Testing Tools</b><br>
* <b>Cross-Platform:</b> are support all mobile platforms, including iOS, Android and Windows such as Appium<br>
* Support many programming languages<br>
* <b>Native:</b> developed, released and support one single mobile platform such as Espresso for Android and XCUITest for iOS<br>
* You can use only Java or Kotlin for Espresso and Swift or Objective-C for XCUITest
<br><br>
<b>Types of Mobile Platforms</b><br>
* <b>Android</b> is both an OS and a software platform for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablet computers, TVs, media players and cars.<br>
* <b>iOS</b> is a mobile OS developed by Apple for the iPhone and iPad touch. Until the beginning of 010 it was called iPhone OS on the iPhone and iPad OS on the iPas, In September 2019, the version for the iPad was launched as an independent iPasOS separated from iOS again.<br>
* <b>Windows Phone</b> is an OS for smartphones that was developed by Microsoft. It has been the preferred OS since the alliance between Microsoft and Nokia announced in February 2011.<br>
<br><br>
<b> Virtual Vs. Real Device</b><br>
<b>Emulators</b><br>
* are usually virtualized mobile devices.
* A good emulator runs exactly the same OS as the physical device that it is emulating, and is therefore a really good option for mobile device testing.
* The disadvantage to using an emulator is that emulators have limitations include hardware components such as Bluetooth receivers, GPS receivers, cameres.
<br>
<b>Physical Devices</b><br>
* Testing on physical devices is a good idea when you need test results to be as accurate as possible.
* Testing on physical device gives you the most accuratte test results because, simply put, you are testing on the actual device on which your software will run.

# 2- Intoduction to Appium
## What is Appium?
* <b>Appium</b> is an <b>open-source</b> tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms.
* <b>Appium</b> is <b>cross-platform</b>: it allows you to write tests against multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows), using the same API.
* You can write <b>Appium</b> tests with different programming languages such as (Java, Python, Javascript, C#, and Ruby).
* Native apps are those written using the iOS, Android, or Windows SDKs. Mobile web apps are web apps accessed using a mobile browser.
